#Japanese Smiley Customizer
============

### About
This project is sort of an extension on one of my earlier projects, the Japanese Smiley Generator. The generator allows you to create thousands of random smileys at a time. In this project, you're given a fancy UI built using Javascript/jQuery to customize a single smiley. The smiley is built of containing brackets, eyes, a mouth, arms, and extra bits I call flairs. Once you customize the smiley you want, you can click a button to select the text for copying as well as an option to submit it to a smiley database. The smiley database is shown in a simple jQuery ticker on the bottom of the screen. Most interaction with PHP in this project uses AJAX and does not require a page reload to see updated data.
